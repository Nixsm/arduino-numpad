Source code for my custom numpad, tested with Arduino Leonardo and a Pro micro.

You should check the pins on the code.

I'm not responsible for any damage that this code may cause on your board.

# Instructions
 * Unzip the HID.7z and Keyboard.7z
 * Replace your current HID and Keyboard libraries in the arduino folder with the ones you just unzipped, HID is usually under the hardware folder and Keyboard is under the libraries folder


Reminder: I do not own the HID and Keyboard Library, I just modified them to get the num lock status
